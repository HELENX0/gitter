Why is an automated approach to data manipulation better than a manual approach? Why should we write code to manipulate data rather than do it by hand?\nThe key benefit of writing code to manipulate data is that the method\ncan be scrutinised by others (or you at a later date, ‘future you’) and\ncan be repeated.
